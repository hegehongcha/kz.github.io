I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by Prof. Liang Zhan. **My research interests** are automatic evaluation metrics, text generation, and healthcare AI. Now I am focused on radiology report generation and healthcare AI.
